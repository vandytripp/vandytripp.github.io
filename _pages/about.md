Hello, and welcome to my site! My name is Alexander Tripp (but you can call me Alec), and I am a Research Manager with the Scientific Research Group (SRG) at YouGov. I hold my PhD in Political Science from Vanderbilt University, with concentrations in Comparative Politics and Methodology, and I am a public opinion and behavioral researcher.

My dissertation explored how and why individuals' views on immigration shift in response to immigration shocks, focusing on the Colombian government, media, and mass public responses to recent Venezuelan immigration. My other publications investigate 1) host country attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, immigrant and refugee attitudes toward integration and remigration, and large language model (LLM) research in social science contexts. Most of my dissertation research has a regional focus on Latin America, though I have additional projects in Uganda and the United States. I was formerly an affiliate of Vanderbilt's CSDI, ROCCA, and RIPS labs, as well as the Center for Global Democracy. In 2020, I graduated with a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. 

If you have any questions, please drop me an email!
