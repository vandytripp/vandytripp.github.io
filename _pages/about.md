Hello, and welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate at Vanderbilt University, and I study public opinion with a substantive focus on attitudes toward immigrants and refugees. I also work on the flip side of this topic, investigating immigrant and refugee attitudes toward integration and remigration. Most of my research has a regional focus on Latin America, though I have ongoing projects in Uganda and the United States.

My dissertation explores how and why individuals' views on immigration shift in response to immigration crises, focusing on the Colombian government, media, and mass public responses to the Venezuelan crisis. My expected PhD completion date is May 2025. 

I address my research questions with a variety of empirical approaches, including surveys, experiments, text-as-data, and causal inference. I complement these empirical methods with interviews, focus groups, and content analyses to produce well-rounded research on the politics of immigration. I work with policy implications in mind, so as to contribute to host society efforts for improving migrant integration, reducing xenophobia, and crafting sustainable approaches to the reception of migrant inflows. 

I am an affiliate of Vanderbilt's LAPOP, ROCCA, and RIPS labs. In 2020, I graduated with a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
