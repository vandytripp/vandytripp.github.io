1 3/4 cups sugar (1 cup granulated and 3/4 cup brown)
2 1/4 lbs (36 oz) cream cheese at room temperature
1/4 tsp salt
5 eggs
2 cups heavy cream
1/4 cup all purpose flour
1 tbsp vanilla

Preheat oven at 400 degrees. 

Line 10in springform pan with parchment paper along bottom and sides (helps to crumple up first). 

In a large bowl, cream sugar and cream cheese. Add salt and mix until smooth. Add eggs one at a time and beat until fully incorporated. Beat in the cream and vanilla on low, and then gradually sift in the flour.

Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until browned/almost burnt on top, 50-60 minutes. Center will still be jiggly. Remove cake from oven and cool completely on rack (this takes several hours, and some recommend refrigerating overnight). 

Graham cracker crust:
1 cup crushed (to dust) graham crackers (put in ziplock and smoosh with hands/rolling pin)
4.5 tbsp butter
2 tbsp brown sugar

Cook in oven for 5 min at 350. Let cool before pouring batter into it. 

Alec notes: 
Lots of room for fun additions here. Could add fruit (peppered strawberries?), or cook for less time (30 min then let sit in fridge overnight). 
- On my first attempt, I think I cooked it at 350 instead of 400. Took about 70 min. I then let it sit on the counter for an hour, then in the fridge for an hour, then in the freezer for an hour. It was fairly runny in the middle. Still tasty, but better to make a day in advance.
