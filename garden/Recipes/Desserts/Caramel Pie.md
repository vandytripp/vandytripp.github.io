1 graham cracker crust (8in)

2 cans (28 oz) Sweetened Condensed Milk

Cool Whip (optional to top; about 1/2 tub)

Remove paper from cans. Place cans in a pot large enough to submerge them completely in water. Fill with water to cover cans. Bring to a low boil. Cover and continue low boil for 3 hours. Add water as needed to keep cans submerged. Carefully remove cans and place on a towel. Cool for 10 minutes. Open cans carefully. Pour caramel into pie crust. Freeze for at least 3 hours. Remove from freezer and spread Cool Whip on top. Return to freezer until ready to serve.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
