Bake for 30 minutes

Brittany notes: 
- Cake took 45 min instead of 30. 
	- Maybe only fill pan up halfway. 
- Bowl 1- cream shortening and sugar then add eggs
- Bowl 2- Flour, salt, cocoa
- Add a little bit of Bowl 2 to Bowl 1, then add a little bit of buttermilk, and so on until everything is in Bowl 1. 
- Add vanilla, food coloring, vinegar, and baking soda to Bowl 1.
