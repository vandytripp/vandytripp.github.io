1 bag collard greens
1 cup chicken broth (or more of you want; beef is not great as a replacement)
1 tbsp EVOO or butter
2 tsp hot smoked paprika (or regular is fine)
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper

Mix oil and spices into a bowl and pour over greens in Instant Pot bowl. Cook for 4 minutes on high. Once done, release steam, drain, and serve.
