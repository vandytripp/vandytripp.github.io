  
5 large sweet potatoes
1/2 stick of butter
1/2 cup brown sugar (to taste)
2 eggs
Pinch of salt

Preheat oven at 350. 

Peel and boil sweet potatoes until soft. Let cool a little, then mash potatoes. Add butter, brown sugar, and eggs. Blend thoroughly. Pour into a casserole dish.

Bake for about 25 minutes.

Then, right before serving, put marshmallows on top and cook at 425°F (or broil) until marshmallows are browned.
