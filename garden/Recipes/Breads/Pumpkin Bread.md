Combine:
1 3/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cups brown sugar (try experimenting with a heavier brown sugar ratio)
1 cup butter (original recipe calls for corn oil but I don't regularly carry that...maybe try with it or with less butter)
4 beaten eggs

Add and blend 1 can pumpkin

Sift together and add:
3 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp salt
1 tsp cloves (I like cloves)
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp nutmeg
(could also do 1 tsp allspice but I never have it)

Add 2/3 cup water

Bake in 2 greased and floured loaf pans for 1 hour at 350
- Flouring isn't strictly necessary (I haven't tried it) but may help with sticking
