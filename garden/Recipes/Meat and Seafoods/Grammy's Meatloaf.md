1.5 lbs ground beef
1 onion, chopped
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup Italian breadcrumbs
1.5 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 can tomato paste (small can)
1/4 can tomato sauce (15 oz can)

Preheat oven at 350. 

Combine all to form loaf. 

Sauce: 
3/4 can tomato sauce
5 tbsp brown sugar
2 tsp Worcestshire sauce
3 tbsp white vinegar
2 tbsp mustard

Mix together and pour over meatloaf. 

Bake for 1.5 hours. 

(Mom's Italian variation is basically the same, but she uses spaghetti sauce instead of the sauce and adds 1 cup shredded parmesan cheese to the loaf)
