Big fillet steelhead trout
3 tbsp melted butter or oil
Lemon juice
Spices (herbes de Provence style or Cajun/old bay style)
3-4 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 tsp dried dill weed
Salt and pepper to taste
Lemon slices for topping

Preheat oven to 375°F. Stir oil into lemon juice, garlic, spices, salt and pepper. Place large piece of foil on baking sheet and a bit of oil on bottom. Add trout to foil, dry off with paper towel, and squeeze lemon juice over top. Drizzle oil spice mixture over fish. Lay lemon slices on top. 

Cover trout tightly with foil (leave some room inside but no holes). Bake for 20 minutes. Turn oven to broil at 400°F, uncover fish, and bake additional 3-4 minutes until opaque and flaky.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
