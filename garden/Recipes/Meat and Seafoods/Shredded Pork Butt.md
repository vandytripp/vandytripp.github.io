4-6 lbs pork butt (boneless), trim off fat
1 diced onion
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup EVOO
3 tbsp packed brown sugar
1 tbsp salt and paprika
1 tsp pepper, onion and garlic powder, and cumin
2 oz apple cider vinegar (or a shot of brown liquor of your choice)
1 can Dr. Pepper (or your soda of choice)
1 can beer (of your choice)
(Could also add a can of pineapple juice alongside the other liquids)

Preheat oven at 300 and warm up dutch oven med-high. 

Cut pork into several large pieces. Combine brown sugar, spices, and rub onto pork. Sear each side of the pork pieces (3-4 min each side). Then cook onion and garlic until fragrant. 

Add beer, Dr. Pepper, and a shot of apple cider vinegar. Cover with lid and place in oven. Cook for 3 hours. Remove lid and cook for 1.5 hours more. Check if done by trying to shred with forks...if it comes apart easily, it's done!
