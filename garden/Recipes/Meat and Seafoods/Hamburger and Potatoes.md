1 lb ground beef
6 potatoes, sliced
1/2 stick butter
1 packet Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix

Salt and pepper to taste

Cook ground beef and drain. Add sliced potatoes. Sprinkle soup mix on top of potatoes. Cover with water (may need more or less water to do so). Put butter on top. Cook until potatoes start to soften (but not mushy).
