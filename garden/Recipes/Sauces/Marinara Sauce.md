28 oz whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes (canned)
1/4 cup EVOO
7 cloves garlic, minced
Red pepper flakes to taste
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp oregano

Crush tomatoes with hands in large bowl. Pour 1 cup water into can to get rest of juices and set aside. Heat oil in saucepan, sizzle garlic, add tomatoes and water. 

Add red pepper flakes, salt, and oregano. Stir and simmer for 15 min (until sauce is thickened and oil on surface is deep orange). 

(If you want a thicker sauce, add a can of tomato sauce or paste in addition to the whole peeled tomatoes).
