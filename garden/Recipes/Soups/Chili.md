2 lbs ground beef/turkey
2 tbsp EVOO
1 onion, diced
3 cups beef stock
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 can kidney beans
2 cans pinto beans
1 can black beans
2 packs chili spice mix
1 can rotel
1 large can diced tomatoes
(Advanced edition: brown sugar, curry powder, and sweet peppers)

Heat up oil in dutch oven, then add onions/garlic and cook until fragrant. (If you want to get tricky, add 2-3 tbsp brown sugar here with some sweet peppers. Then add ~1/4 tsp curry powder with spices alongside chili mix.) Add tomato, rotel, and beans (drained and rinsed).

Add beef stock and heat on medium high. Cook meat (seasoned generously with seasoning salt) until just almost fully cooked, then add to pot with oils. Add chili mix, bring to boil and stirring regularly, and then simmer for 10 minutes. 

Serve with sour cream and shredded cheese and peanut butter sandwiches.
